            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>HAving ſeen <hi>John Plimpton</hi>'s Ten Charges againſt the People, call'd <hi>Quakers,</hi> and underſtanding he has aſſum'd to himſelf an Authority of ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointing a <hi>Meeting,</hi> without the Approbation or Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent of the ſaid People, they decline to meet him for theſe Reaſons: <hi>viz.</hi> It being the day of our <hi>County Quarter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Meeting,</hi> which was appointed long before his, both as to Time and Place, we cannot attend him, and was it not ſo? I do not ſee we are obliged to it; becauſe he hath not perform'd the Conditions of <hi>William Penn</hi>'s
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:172101:2"/>Offer, <hi>(viz.)</hi> get the Heads of the <hi>Baptiſts</hi> to Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>barque in him (which he formerly, and alſo lately, gave Expectation of) for <hi>John Amory,</hi> of <hi>Wrinton,</hi> in <hi>Sommerſet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhire;</hi> one of their Apoſtles, or Meſſengers, came with him to <hi>John Rutty</hi>'s, in <hi>Melkeſham,</hi> the 17th. of the laſt Mo. and did then, and there, in the Preſence of <hi>J. P.</hi> himſelf, and divers Witneſſes, refuſe to Sign his Charges againſt us, and to imbarque in him, either for the freewill <hi>Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſts,</hi> in general, or himſelf in particular; and alſo ſaid he knew no body that would, and blamed him for an Indiſcreet Conduct therein; adviſing him to be quiet, and ſince that <hi>William Earl</hi> did alſo refuſe to ſign them, when put to him by <hi>Peter Knight, Simon Shewring,</hi> and <hi>John Rutty;</hi> and therefore, Now, becauſe I believe he will pervert our Writings, behind our Backs, in picking a Sentence here, and another there, without due Regard to the Context (a very unfair Method) out of Books, whoſe Doctrines I queſtion not, are Coherent to what I have here aſſerted; the Scope of them, being duely obſerv'd (which would be tedious for a Defendant in a Diſcourſe, <hi>viva voce;</hi> but if he thinks mete to commit his Cavils to Print, he may then expect to ſee an Anſwer to them) Wherefore, for the Truth's ſake, and the ſake of the Simple hearted who are lyable to be abuſed, and impoſed upon by his Fallacies, I thought mete to Print his Charges, with a Sincere and Candid Account of our Faith, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lating thereunto, and to diſperſe the ſame at his <hi>Meet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing;</hi> that all may ſee how extreamly he hath abuſed us.</p>
            <p>As to his Charges againſt me, I intend to anſwer; when he hath purged himſelf of ſeveral Charges, as to Matter of Fact, which I for merly drew up againſt him,
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:172101:2"/>and ſome of his Brethren, in a Letter to them, dated the 5th. of the 10th. Month laſt paſt, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> but they then refuſed to give me a Meeting upon it, and mov'd for an Agreement, which Agreement, the ſaid <hi>J. P.</hi> hath broke, as did clearly appear by his own Words, at my Houſe, the 24th. of the 12th. Month laſt paſt, in the Hearing of <hi>John Yeo, William Holloway,</hi> and <hi>John Ruddle,</hi> one of his Brethren; and <hi>John Ruddle</hi> will ſpeak the Truth, he muſt confeſs that it did evidently appear ſo, and then pray who is the Truce-breaker, <hi>J. Plimpton</hi> or <hi>T. Beaven,</hi> and this Method I think but regular, he being firſt charged; but if he now refuſeth, let him for ever be ſilent.</p>

Theſe things I do boldly af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firm, are the <hi>Quakers</hi> Opinions; and I do charge them upon them; as Heretical and Damnable; and therefore, foraſmuch as the <hi>Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſts</hi> do own me in my Proceed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings againſt them, I do expect that <hi>W.
